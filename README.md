# MvvmCore
This library provides minimal infrastructure for android application building based on Model-View-ViewModel pattern and corresponding Google recommendations and tech-stack like Android Architecture Components, but with less boilerplate that usually takes place when you start Mvvm app from scratch. So, the aim of the MvvmCore is not to showcase the usage of "another modern" feature or lib, but to reduce some usual  infrastructure routines.
